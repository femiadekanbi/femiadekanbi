Hi, I’m Olufemi Adekanbi - a Cloud & DevOps enthusiast currently training in Backend Web Development. My technical journey started with earning the AWS Solutions Architect certification, and I’m now expanding my skills to include:
- Backend Development: APIs, Databases, Server-side Logic
- DevOps Practices: CI/CD pipelines, automation, version control
- Cloud Computing (AWS): Scalable infrastructure and deployment
- Git/GitHub Projects: Open-source collaboration & project documentation

I enjoy combining my business operations background with technology to build scalable and efficient solutions. Some of my repositories will showcase:
- API projects
- CI/CD pipeline demos
- Cloud deployment projects
- Backend development practice apps

Outside of tech, I also lead a foundation that supports children with special needs, primarily Autism and Down syndrome, where I apply technology for social good.
I am always open to collaboration and learning from the community.
